# PetriNet
Implementation of a thread-safe Petri net in Java with examples of usage.

# Multiplicator and Alternator
Both example programs build a Petri net. Multiplicator multiplies two numbers, prints the solutions and number of transitions fired.
Alternator launches three threads and prevents two threads to be in the critical section.
